Welcome to pic_cloud!

This project utilizes Clean Architecture principles along with the BLoC (Business Logic Component) pattern to create a robust and maintainable application structure. With Clean Architecture, the project is organized into distinct layers, promoting separation of concerns and testability. BLoC facilitates the management of complex state and business logic, ensuring a clear and scalable codebase.

Key Features:
- **Clean Architecture**: Promotes modularity, testability, and maintainability by separating concerns into layers: Presentation, Domain, and Data.
- **BLoC Pattern**: Manages state and business logic separately from the UI, enabling a reactive and declarative programming style.
- **Easy Testing**: With clear separation of concerns, unit testing becomes straightforward, ensuring code reliability and stability.
- **Scalability**: Designed to accommodate growth and changes in requirements, making it easier to add new features or modify existing ones.

Getting Started:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run `flutter pub get` to install dependencies.
4. Launch the application on your preferred device or simulator.
